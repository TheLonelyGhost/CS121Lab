CS121 - Lab 1
=============

**Date:** 2012-08-23

# Synopsis #

Setup Eclipse, iLocker, and run through some basic string manipulation to make sure everyone is up to speed.

# Part 1: Learn how to use BSU iLocker for Project Storage #

- Create a folder on your iLocker called "CS121", then a subfolder called "workspace".
- Map iLocker as a network drive on your local computer.

# Part 2: Getting Started With Eclipse and Java #

- Create a workspace

# Part 3: String Manipulation #

## Task 1 ##
- Insert a comment labeled `//Task 1`
- Create two strings called `message1` and `message2`.
- Assign the first string to `"Ball State"` and the second to `"Welcomes you!"`
- Concatenate the two strings and print them to the console.

## Task 2 ##
- Insert a few blank lines, then insert a comment labeled `//Task 2`
- Create string `message3` that stores `"BALL STATE UNIVERSITY"`
- Create a string `message4` that stores the lowercase of the above string.
- Print `message4` to console.

## Task 3 ##
- Insert a few blank lines, then insert a comment labeled `//Task 3`
- Create string `message5` that stores the substring of `message4` from above that will result in `message5` containing the phrase `"ALL STATE"`.
- Print `message5` to console.

## Task 4 ##
- Open the new [Java SE 7 API Documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html)
- Navigate to the `Strings` Object (hint: look under `java.lang`)
- Pick *any method* from Strings that we haven't used and implement it similarly to what we have done above.
